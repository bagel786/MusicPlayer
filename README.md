# MusicPlayer

You will need to put all the files in the repository into a folder named "assets", as github wouldn't let me uplaod the files at the same time as they were too large. This program was just a challenge for me to see how I effectively I could use pygame and qt. It pretty much acts like spotify, but I couldn't figure out a way to grab the playlist from an external web source, so all file have to be uploaded and hard-written into the code.
